# AI Recognize person by voice
Record your voice and the system predicts your name.

Note: The prediction is not perfect — this was an experimental project.

This project was created under a limited time frame. Both the prediction and training algorithms could be heavily improved. Currently, only the Mel-spectrogram prediction model is implemented.
Other audio features such as chroma, zero-crossing rate, MFCC, spectral centroid, etc., have training algorithms in train.py, but I didn’t combine them into a final model due to lack of experience at the time.

This was my first official machine learning project (after some small experiments like the Pokémon Legendary Guesser and an income predictor). I learned a lot more than I expected.
